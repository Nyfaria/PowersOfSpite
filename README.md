A new superpower mod is just around the corner…

## What happened here?

A group of scientists discovered a new, rare chemical deep in the ground, near bedrock. After dubbing it “spite”, they did some testing and found that it could be made into a strange but magical serum which gives you a random power for the rest of your life! This was kept a secret for many years until news broke out.

Now, the powers are yours to discover…

## How it works

To obtain this magical serum, a few steps need to be followed:
Mine Spite ore to obtain Raw Spite
Brew Raw Spite with an Awkward Potion to make Chemical S
Brew the Chemical S with a Diamond Block in the brewing stand to make Spite Serum!
Use (right-click with serum in hand) the Spite serum to give yourself a random power! You can have maximum three powers at a time. Press V to see your powers (customizable in Keybinds menu)!

## Two types of powers

Active powers are powers that you can activate and deactivate on command. They show on the top left of your screen with the keybind used for toggling them. You can also see and change the keybinds in the bottom if the keybinds menu. Some examples of these include invisibility, ghost, etc.

Passive powers are powers that you always have and cannot be toggled. For example, flight, super strength, etc are passive. These do not show at the top left but can be seen in the Power Screen (by clicking V).

## /powers Command

You can also add, remove, and clear powers via the `/powers` command, but this is not meant for survival gameplay scenario.

## Important

This mod is still in Beta. Yes, bugs can exist - that's why betas exist! We plan on adding more content to this mod with some time, including ways to make powers, remove powers, and more powers in general. We also want to improve the visuals of this mod. Most of this mod is a WIP.
